# Text_to_art_with_AI_enlarging
Leveraging the power of several machine learning algorithms, this colab Notebook will enable anyone with little to no knowledge of computers or algorithms to develop some pretty cool artwork. Credit goes to the original authors. 

> Wanting to provide a solution for my artist friends who didn't have an easier way to divulge into the world of *generating art by writing only*.
> <br> This project was made for anyone who just wants to click on steps and gwt the result without getting bogged down by details like initial image, final image, seed, etc.
> It can be run without any input and it outputs for a default text prompt of 'ice castles on hilltop'


Insctructions to run:
* Follow the insctructions and run each cell(block of code).
* Input the text (or not!) and maybe, choose a few art styles if you fancy. 
* Click on a few more buttons to get the final image, along with a timelapse video of the creation process, download any number of pictures on process completion.
